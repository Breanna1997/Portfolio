            <h1><span>A Little About me</span></h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm<strong> Breanna Brownlee</strong> before programming I was a Sophmore majoring
               in Education. I have a passion for growing the minds of children. As I was preparing to take my last 
               class to receive my Associats degree in Education but during that time COVID had just been annouced and
                I was not able to take my last class due to social distancing. When this huge unexpecte change happen I 
                realized that being a educator wasn't the work life that I actually enjoy. My husband began to encourage
                 me to look into the Tech industry so I did. I began Teaching myself HTML CSS and JavaScripts using books 
                 by Murachs. I fell inlove with Watching what I created come life. Even the smallest thing like 
                 <q>Hello World!</q> excited me.</p>
            <br />
          <p>After a year of being self taught I decided to enroll into a STLCC to obtain 
            an Associate Degree in Software Development. During my time at STLCC I've taken courses such as Web 
            Technologies where I learned more about HTML CSS and JavaScript, Web Scripting that taught more about 
            JavaScript and JQuery, C# I course where I learned the fundamentals of object programming using C#, and 
            Graphic Design course where I learned how to use Adobe Photoshop and Canva. Outside of college I'm also 
            enrolled in a UX Designer Google Certification course through Digital Strike a local digital marketing 
            company.</p>
