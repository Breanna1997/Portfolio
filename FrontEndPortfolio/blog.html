            <h1><span>About me</span></h1>
              <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Breanna Brownlee</strong> before programming I was a Sophomore majoring
               in Education. I have a passion for growing the minds of children. Prior to the pandemic I was preparing
               to take my last class to receive my Associates degree in Education. However, during that period it had
               just been announced that remaining courses would be taken remote due to social distancing. This came as an
               unexpected change and it was during this time I reevaluated pursuing a degree in Education.
              <br>
              <br>
               My husband who is a software engineer introduced me to a number of web resources and mentioned I should look into 
               studying computer science. I began teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the books <i>Murach's HTML and CSS</i>
               along with <i>Murach's JavaScript and JQuery</i> I fell in love with watching what I created come to life. Even the smallest thing like 
              <q>Hello World!</q> excited me.
            </p>
            <br>
          <p>
            After a year of being self taught I decided to enroll into a STLCC to obtain 
            an Associate Degree in Software Development. During my time at STLCC I've taken courses such as Web 
            Technologies where I learned more about HTML CSS and JavaScript, Web Scripting that taught more about 
            JavaScript and JQuery, C# a course where I learned the fundamentals of object programming using C#, and 
            Graphic Design course where I learned how to use Adobe Photoshop and Canva. Outside of college I'm also 
            enrolled in a UX Designer Google Certification course through Digital Strike a local digital marketing 
            company.
